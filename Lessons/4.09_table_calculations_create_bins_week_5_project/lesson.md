# Lesson 4.9: Advanced Tableau

### Lesson Duration: 3 hours

> Purpose: The purpose of this lesson is to introduce Tableau features such as _creating bins_, _creating calculated fields_, and use some quick table calculations and other user-defined table calculations. We will also talk about topics for projects students will be working the next week.

---

### Setup

- All previous set up

### Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to:

- Create bins from numerical columns/measures
- Create simple calculated fields using functions
- Use the `IF-ELSE` conditions to create user-defined buckets/bins
- Select your preferred project brief for a mid-bootcamp project

:exclamation: Note to instructor: After you explain the project and its objectives, please make sure that the students pick a project (out of the two choices available) by the end of the day. If they have time, they can also start working on the project. Also let them know that for this project, we have chosen the topics for them but for the final project, the students can choose a topic of their own choice. It would be important to emphasize that they should choose a project where they can showcase their skills well, learned during the bootcamp.

- In this exercise, we are trying to compare Control and Test Variations along with the number of clients who were present in the different steps in the complete process.
- Please refer to the tableau public link [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/himanshu.aggarwal2552#!/vizhome/lesson_4_9_1/number_participants_by_variation-Step3).
- Instructions to obtain the plots are mentioned in the individual sheets
- Tableau files are also attached to the folder.

Encourage the students to play around with the features to learn more. Some of the things that the students can do could be:

- Reproduce the plot.
- Switch rows and columns and check if the plot looks better visually.
- Add another measure along with the Count of clients.
- Switch Test to the left and Control to the right.
- Color code the data based on the process step.
- For the tip detail add some other piece of information. <!-- ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ @himanshu: what does this mean? -->

- Table calculations

<details>
  <summary> Click for Code Sample:  </summary>

- In this exercise, we are trying to find the percent of dropouts in each step of the process/ percent of people who continued to the next stage. And we are trying to compare between Control and Test variations.
- Please refer to the tableau public link [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/himanshu.aggarwal2552#!/vizhome/lesson_4_9_2_table_calculations/percentage_drops3).
- Instructions to obtain the plots are mentioned in the individual sheets
- Tableau files are also attached to the folder.

:exclamation: Note for instructor: Encourage the students to play around with the features to learn more. The instructor should suggest some ideas for the students to try.

### Lesson 3 key concepts

> :clock10: 20 min

- Create bins using the "create bin" option.
- Use the `IF-ELSE` conditional to create bins.

<details>
  <summary> Click for Description: Exercise 1  </summary>

- In the first exercise, we will create bins from the measure Client Age. We will see the distribution of how many people participated in each age group.
- Please refer to the tableau public link [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/himanshu.aggarwal2552#!/vizhome/lesson_4_9_3_calculated_fields_with_bins/createbinsbuckets).
- Tableau files are also attached to the folder.
