# Unit 5 - Mid-Bootcamp Project

**This is the ecuator of the Bootcamp, a good moment to check whether our students are well on track** to continue their learning path towards more advanced topics or we need to put in place complementary strategies to set them for success. 

**The students will choose their challenge,** from both algorithms we learned in the past 4 units:

- Use linear regression to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.
- Use logistic regression to understand the demographics and other characteristics of a bank customers' that accept a credit card offer and that do not accept a credit card.

**For the PT format, unit 5 extends with one extra mini-project that is scheduled right after Unit 1.** The aim of this mini project is to foster autonomy, project management skills, and problem-solving at an early stage in the program. 

- Perform an end-to-end analysis putting into practice statistical or machine learning techniques. Students might choose their own outcomes working with a dataset of football players and matches provided by FIFA.

### **After this unit, students will be able to:**

1. Apply agile Project Management to deliver results
    - Use a Kanban Board to self-manage their projects
    - Prioritize project features/milestones to ensure value delivery
    - Define the project strategically, using a lean approach
2. Present a professional project
    - Produce documentation to make the project accessible
    - Present your project to an audience, accommodating your script to constraints (time, audience, etc.)
    - Build engaging presentations
    - Include storytelling to their presentations
3. Go through the whole Data Analysis process on their own, without much support. 
4. Get the data to SQL Database
    - Write the right queries to extract the information they need.
5. Connect to the database to Python and interpret the structure
    - Pull the data as a dataframe in python.
    - Perform data cleaning and data wrangling in Python
6. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis 
    - Fit the model
    - Check accuracy of the model (exploring *Variance vs. Bias* tradeoff)
    - Iterate on the model to get more optimized results.

# Project | Deliverables
ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ @Himanshu @Sandra I'd need to check this !

- The students will be required to upload the project on GitHub.
- The repo should be properly organized with specific use of folders and it should follow the naming conventions for folders.
- Make sure that the students update the `Readme.md` file in the repo describing the project, its purpose, and also briefly describing the methodology used to solve the problems.
